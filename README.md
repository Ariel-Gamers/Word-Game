# Word-Game

This project implements the core functionality of the word game - in the game, you will have to give the definition of the word. 

For the core functionality, a random correct word is generated and for demonstration it is shown in green.

If you pick the correct word, you will go to the next level and the score will increase. If you pick an incorrect word, you will lose your extra life. Picking an incorrect word twice 
ends the game. 

The whole functionality is defined at the main game handler: `GameSystem.cs`
